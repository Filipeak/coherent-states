# Quantum States Calculation

## Overview
Project for Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. Goal was to simulate some quantum mechanics functions and their evolution in time.

## Features
- Calculating and plotting coherent states
- Calculating and plotting squeezed coherent states

## Usage
It's all written in Python so install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and run program you want:
```
python src/coherent.py
python src/squeezed.py
```
Files will be generated in ```generated``` folder.
